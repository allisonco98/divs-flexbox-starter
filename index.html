                <p>I grew up in a small town in southeast Texas, Hankamer, Tx. I spent most of my childhood playing outside in the dirt and hanging out with 
                    all our dogs and animals. I graduated high school and spent a few more years living there and now I'm temporarily 
                    living in Austin, Tx.

                I have been a stay at home mom for 5 1/2 years now. I got pregnant very young at 18 years old in 2016 and even though I was scared of the future, I was
                also very excited to be a mom. I had another baby in 2018, my kids have been my entire world since then. I can't lie and say it's been easy because it's 
                been the hardest thing I've had to go through but it has also been equally amazing.

            <div class="div-3">
                Fun Fact: I have always had an extreme obsession with horses. As a kid if I wasn't outside then I was playing with toy horses or reading everything I could 
                about them. I think they are just the most beautiful creatures and I have never got tired of them and I hope to own many horses one day.
